# Basic GuideBook to Path of Exile's League Mechanics

This web app helps new Path of Exile players by introducing and briefly explaining some of Path of Exile's league mechanics. Some of these mechanics can be quite diffcult to understand and what they are supposed to be at a glance value. Additionally, there is a marketplace that users can access to preview what other users are listing for sale. Users are required to be logged in to be able to create their own listings on the market.

## Home Page
The user can navigate through each of the pages through the menu icon at the top left or by pressing the league buttons on the home page. There is also a market button 
next to the menu icon that redirects the user to the marketplace.

## League Pages
Each league will have its own page where its basic league mechanics are briefly explained to the user. There will also be several pictures that will help visualize certain things that may be confusing. 

## Marketplace
The marketplace contains all listings that other users have created to put on the market. Listings contain the type of item they are selling including a timestamp of when it was posted. Users will be able to contact each other with the username given on each listing, where they can message each other ingame.

## Login/Register Page
The Login and Register Page is found at the top right, where the user can create an account to participate in the marketplace. If the user has an existing account, they can login with their information. Once logged in, there will be a profile icon next to the menu icon at the top right. Clicking this will direct you to your profile page, where you can create listings for the market and delete existing ones.
